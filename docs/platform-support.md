# Platform Support

Greywall supports Linux and macOS with platform-specific sandboxing technologies.

## Feature comparison

| Feature | Linux | macOS |
|---------|:-----:|:-----:|
| **Sandbox engine** | bubblewrap | sandbox-exec (Seatbelt) |
| **Filesystem deny-by-default (read/write)** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Syscall filtering** | ✅ (seccomp) | ✅ (Seatbelt) |
| **Filesystem access control** | ✅ (Landlock + bubblewrap) | ✅ (Seatbelt) |
| **Violation monitoring** | ✅ (eBPF) | ✅ (Seatbelt denial logs) |
| **Transparent proxy (full traffic capture)** | ✅ (tun2socks + TUN) | ❌ |
| **DNS capture** | ✅ (DNS bridge) | ❌ |
| **Proxy via env vars (SOCKS5 / HTTP)** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Network isolation** | ✅ (network namespace) | N/A |
| **Command allow/deny lists** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Credential substitution (env vars)** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Credential substitution (`.env` files)** | ✅ (bind-mount rewrite) | ⚠️ (files denied; see below) |
| **Environment sanitization** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Learning mode** | ✅ (strace) | ✅ (eslogger, requires sudo) |
| **PTY support** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **External deps** | bwrap, socat, xdg-dbus-proxy (optional) | none |

## Linux

Greywall uses [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) for container-free sandboxing, layering multiple kernel security features:

- **seccomp** — BPF-based syscall filtering to block dangerous syscalls
- **Landlock** — kernel filesystem access control (Linux 5.13+), restricts file operations independently of bubblewrap mount rules
- **D-Bus isolation** — blocks the session bus to prevent sandbox escape via GVFS file reads, gnome-keyring password access, and Flatpak portal process launch
- **eBPF** — real-time violation monitoring for blocked syscalls and file access attempts
- **Network namespace** — full network isolation via `unshare-net`; all traffic flows through tun2socks into the SOCKS5 proxy
- **DNS bridge** — socat relay that captures DNS queries inside the namespace and forwards them to a configured DNS server

All features degrade gracefully when the kernel or permissions don't support them. Run `greywall --linux-features` to see what's available on your system.

**Dependencies:** `bubblewrap`, `socat`, and `xdg-dbus-proxy` (optional, for `notify-send` support inside the sandbox).

## macOS

Greywall uses `sandbox-exec` with dynamically generated [Seatbelt](https://reverse.put.as/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Apple-Sandbox-Guide-v1.0.pdf) profiles. The Seatbelt profile controls file reads/writes, network access, process operations, and Mach IPC.

Network traffic is routed through greyproxy via `ALL_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables. There is no full traffic capture (no TUN device or DNS bridge), so only applications that honor proxy environment variables are redirected.

Learning mode uses Apple's Endpoint Security framework via `eslogger` to trace filesystem access. This requires `sudo` (only `eslogger` runs as root, the sandboxed command runs as the current user).

**Dependencies:** none (sandbox-exec and eslogger ship with macOS)

### `.env` file credential substitution on macOS

On Linux, greywall uses bubblewrap's `--ro-bind` to mount rewritten `.env` files (containing credential placeholders) over the originals. The sandboxed process reads `.env` as usual and gets placeholder values transparently.

macOS has no equivalent of bind-mount namespaces. A Seatbelt profile can control whether a file is readable but cannot redirect a read to a different file. As a result, `.env` files are **denied entirely** in the sandbox profile when credential substitution is active, and the sandboxed process receives a permission-denied error if it tries to read them.

This affects applications that read credentials from `.env` files on disk rather than from environment variables. Environment variable substitution works identically on both platforms.

**Workaround**: use `--inject` to provide credentials as environment variables (with placeholder values) instead of relying on `.env` files. See [Credential Protection](./credential-protection) for the full walkthrough.
